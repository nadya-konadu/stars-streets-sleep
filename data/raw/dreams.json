Anyways mans was a red flag and all he could tell me was “hey please tell ur dad not to mess up the theme of the house” Next i somehow end up in his room (babymama is there too) and now hes feeling me up and Im so uncomfy cuz he literally has made no small talk and is being so selfish. His sister comes into the room and os being a snob too, shes tryna ask him to eat but not me. He has a HUGE family and the next day they visit and make rude comments about me. Then im in the garage at my house, with all his family members and the “lead” keeps talking shit. Last vision is I keep looking back at my dad in the corner of the garage, disappointed that this is what I ended up in.",

We’re on a platform where its not flooded and so I can’t go deeper, and my family friends and I can’t find their bodies. The day goes on, and I visit this neighbourhood lady’s restaurant (shes not a nice person, often judgemental), and whilst I’m ordering my food, I sit on the bar stool and start crying and she starts to console me. Then the day goes on, flood seems to disappear, and I go back home. I reconvene with whatever family is left and cry some more.

I remember it got close to us and we shot it but had to run away because more of its kind were onto us. Eventually we got back to this ski lodge and I remember playing this gambling game where you throw 2 dice up a ramp and then check the dice amount you get. If you get snake eyes then you get a really big money prize. I threw it and ended up getting snake eyes. Then after that happened I heard a big eruption outside of the house and saw that an avalanche began in one of the nearby mountains. I never had seen an avalanche in my life but if I ever saw one it would be like this. I remember it eventually reached the lodge but died out and wasn’t as devastating",

There was a massive amount of students that came for this event, close to 200 or so. It was our largest residence event ever. Unfortunately I never got to play because I was still setting up this last net. It kept on being too high for a badminton net. Me and this coworker who I don’t like very much were confused as to why we couldn’t get the height right. Eventually after enough effort we realized we were using volleyball posts instead of badminton posts for the net. We quickly tore it down and abandoned putting up a net in that court because there wasn’t any badminton posts left.",

I was attending a lecture being done by the registrar, but Hozier was teaching it. He didn’t sing anything, he just informed us on the school. Then I left and kept seeing all of my friends walking by. I was on the upper floor with two friends and I spotted pinkpantheress on the lower floor. I tried to tell my friends that it was pinkpantheress but they didn’t believe me. Two of my other friends on the lower floor spotted her and got photos with her, which resulted in a swarm of students wanting photos with her. I didn’t get any pictures with her though :(",

We were outside by the bus stop during the argument and leaves kept falling on my head because it was autumn and it had just stopped raining.

I was arguing with them and yelling at them, then they kicked me out. My mom told me that I had to get groceries and she left the car in the taxes parking lot. I got in the car with my little sister and started driving towards the grocery store but I was nervous because it was only my second time ever driving. We crashed into this car of teenage girls and we all started arguing in an underground parking lot. They wanted me to pay for the damages but I couldn’t afford it so I called my older sister and she called insurance and it was way more expensive than paying up front.

They were whispering and I heard my name being said. I felt my heart drop, I felt like I shouldn’t have heard that because it hurt my feelings, but I thought they were my friends. I tried to ignore it but I heard my name again, “Why did Mckayla turn around? I’m really not trying to look at her face right now”. They continued to speak about me and keep saying my name as if it was impossible for me to hear what they were saying even though I was sat at the row of desks in front of them. I wanted to stand up for myself and confront them but I forgot how to speak. I turn to the person next to me, and it’s my teacher sending me to the principals office.",

The door closed behind me so I ran to another part of the deck floor to take cover but I didn’t make it in time. I look at my feet and I see a jellyfish that had made it onto the ship. I try to run back inside again but I was too late and got dragged into the ocean. I look at the glass and see my mom at the window screaming for me as I fall backward into the cold water.

Someone came up to me and started to judge my note organization and the fact that I was organizing in the 1st place. Don’t remember exactly what was said, but it was something along the lines of “why are you doing that?” and “it’s a waste of time”. Tried to defend myself, but couldn’t find the words to do so.

Felt like a ‘fake’ setting (like a backdrop for a play) since the castles looked like they were made of foam and there seemed to be a barrier of something (more cliffs?) on the sides of the castles as if encasing them. Jumped to the next castle’s island to explore it and get a better view of the 1st castle. Somehow knew a war was coming and ran to the edge of the island. 2nd castle I was at disappeared and cannons and other weapons took its place (1st castle was still there though). Started to shoot at each other. I was just a witness. Small boats appeared with vikings. Vikings were going to attack both castles. Castles had to stop fighting and work together.",

Turned into El from Stranger Things. A non-existent older brother teased/chased me. Ended up in a house. Father came to pick me up but I was packing for so long so he was napping in car when I came out. He told me he met Joe Biden. Got to a school computer lab similar to in previous dreams. Lined up to talk to someone. Girl from Squid Game 2 was also in my biology class. Asked questions through headphones. When it was my turn, I was somehow announcing my questions into the computer lab and others can watch me like a Zoom meeting. Asked for help with booking 3D printing time slots, but person started to talk about “non-credit opportunities”.",

Father left to go to the washroom or something so was only with bro (playing video games) and a cart of stuff (our jackets). Left brother behind to get more icing. Went across mall to an indoor mountain. Climbed it since it would get me more icing. Idk if I actually got anything. Bro met up with me and I jumped down from climbing. Realized he forgot our cart.

Member poked head through door to ask me stuff, give tips, then left. Water came on. Saw a dead flayed fish on ground. Felt bad and put it in a container of water. Also saw an eel on ground and put in container. Eel revived and swam away. Naked for a bit (to shower?). After shower, kept exploring area. Saw large vents that I could walk through. Harry Potter and friends showed up. Wanted to climb to top of Hogwarts castle which just appeared. We did and snuck around the top and used vents to spy on people.",

Walked in with mother and brother but split up to go find things. Places I mostly ended up had plants and music items. Held a small plant at one point. Browsed musical instruments (mostly electric guitars). Interacted with other customers, including a tall girl with a guitar. Some areas were lit up well, others were not.

Quite empty. Saw some kites in the sky and watched. Then saw a very large kite that looked like a cool steampunk airship made of light brown cloth and a wooden frame. Looked like it had many “fish fins” sticking out. A Canadian guy or Canada enthusiast (was wearing lots of Canada-themed clothes) was flying under it by hold onto a bar like a hang glider. Crashed into a huge Canada flag and guy fell to the ground. Ran to check on him. He was perfectly okay. Then I checked my phone and saw negative comments about yesterday’s presentation I had in real life.",

Told by person at front desk that we needed to form groups. Tried to coordinate with family members and random ‘friends’ (strangers?) of who can/will go and when. Was messy. Got glowy wristbands. 1 group went in before my group. Tried to find my group to also go in but they all scattered somewhere. Left to go search in shop. Finally rounded them up and went in together. When entering, was behind a large boulder prop. Realized it was no longer laser tag since we never got equipment? But the arena still resembled one for laser tag as it was dark and glowy/neon. But also became like a giant play area with large structures to climb. Had some underwater theming.",

I don’t know how this happened but I guess I started swimming and I got lost at sea and a orca was beside me doing jumps out of the water. There was also a boat beside me so I was a bit scared that I be hit by the boat or ate by the orca. Then I got home and was at my boyfriends. I woke up in his room in my dream and I thought I was really awake. This was a horror part of the dream because we kept looking out the window and someone was trying to break in. They were holding a lantern and roaming around outside.",

I also hated the people I was with because they were so try hard annoying when we were literally doing nothing. Then I went in this van with my boyfriend to get ice cream.

One of them was notably Toni Kroos, who is a former soccer player from Germany and he was my favorite player for a long time. We had a conversation on some of my personal stories (I believe it was about the crush that I have in undergrad). One detail of the dream is that I am able to speak fluent German, which I personally cannot in real life (before I went to bed I did my duolingo German lessons).The emotion impact of the dream was high because it is exciting for me to be able to speak to and have a close up look of my favorite player in my dream.",

Some were microscopic and crawling everywhere. While I was opening this map, I was talking to two other people (I knew them but I couldn’t quite remember exactly who they were) about my upcoming time in the region. As they were asking questions, these bugs flooded onto me and started to bite me. I felt like I could never get rid of them. It still feels like I have a bite mark on my knee after waking up",

For some reason we also had a baby with us. The baby was very cute and had somewhat bushy eyebrows for a baby. Then I started PLUCKING the eyebrows (WTF??) and of course the baby HATED that. (why would ANYONE pluck a baby’s eyebrows??) I switched to soothing the baby instead. The next time I looked closely at the baby I noticed that his legs looked like a seal’s tail. I remember thinking “babies are kind of like seals”. Eyebrow incident aside, the baby and I got along swimmingly, and holding him made me feel a sense of peace and comfort.",

Some characters were relevant to my life, but others were deep pulls (I.e old classmates). Some of the characters also were named the same things as people I know in real life, but they looked and behaved differently. I think it was a survival scenario. As the days drew on, it became clear that some of the randos in the dream were easier to cooperate with, and less frustrating to be around than some of the people who I am closer to in real life. It was kind of fun (but also frustrating) exploring the social dynamics, and I enjoyed hiking around the snowy mountains without feeling tired",

I could hear my frustrated thoughts from when I was reading the book before I feel asleep echo in my head. \"What are y'all doing!?\" \"This is a bad idea.\" \"Oh my god.\" Weirdly, it took place on the red sofa of my childhood room. The lights in the room were off but it was bright with lights pouring in from the hallway since the door was wide open. Anyone would be able to walk in and, eventually, someone did. It was my aunt. She comes in the drop something off (a pair of breasts, cartoon like in nature) while the male lead becomes an ex of mine (Saige). We watch and giggle at my aunt place the pair on the floor beside the bed. She doesn't seem to know we're there.",

Once safe inside a cave, we walked around and watched the monkeys pretending and morphing into humans but not able to speak English. They looked like wax statues. They chase us into an apartment.In the kitchen, I'm given frozen meat to defrost. I recognize that it's human. I flashback to when I catapulted across rooftops to tie up and burn a man alive. Banging on the door brings me back to the apartment. Looking through the peephole I see orange chimps. 1 of the 2 new men that are part of my team says our friends are blue. I look out again and see a green chimp. I put my full weight against the door as it threatened to open.",
